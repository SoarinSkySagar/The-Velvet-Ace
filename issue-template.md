# Issue Template

## **Overview**
<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of the issue or feature request -->
<!-- Include the context, what needs to be implemented, and why it is needed -->

## **What does this mean?**
<!-- Detail what specific changes or implementations are required -->
<!-- Include any behavior changes, new functionality, or fixes needed -->
<!-- Optional: Provide implementation hints, suggestions, or guidance -->
<!-- Mention any helper functions, design patterns, or approaches that might be useful -->
<!-- Reference related issues using #issue_number format -->

## **Furthermore?**
<!-- Additional requirements and guidelines for contributors -->

* I'm afraid but this task may only require relevant questions in the poker game... I may not be able to help in any other questions, I'm sorry.
* Your code must be **strongly typed** for better readability please 🙏🏻
* Document your code please, in a professional manner. Please avoid using too many small comments as you should know, only comment on hard to understand logic, and maybe some explanations on how and why it works
* When done, @ your username in a comment on top of the function you touched. If there's one there already, append with a comma and a space. (`// @ExistingUsername, @YourUsername`, etc)... It's cooler to leave your signature behind, yes? 😋
* Each `//` should be accompanied by a space, before typing, lock in.
* Please avoid code repetition. There may be lines of codes that would be reused, please extract them into a separate function. Lock in your good PR quality please 🙏🏻
* May the force be with you ☪️✋🏻
* Of course, if you have any questions (Which I bet you'd have, one billion per cent), you can branch here or here. Happy Hacks 😊💙
